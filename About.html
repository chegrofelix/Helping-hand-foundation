        <h1>What We Do:</h1>
        <div class="image"><img src="images/images/ii.jpeg"></div>
    <p>Together, we work for slums to be improved and integrated into the city fabric. We work to influence changes in practice and policy – especially national policy for urban development. We negotiate, design, and deliver real improvements to people's lives. And we work as a self help group. We know that our unity is our strength.</p>
    <div class="content"><img src="/images/jackie.jpeg"></div>
    <p>We believe that slum communities should be at the centre of city and national development. Slums and slum residents are not an anomaly or problem, they are a vital part of the city and how it functions. <a href="Helping hands">Helping hands</a>volunteer to improve their settlements – challenging the idea that slum residents are only passive beneficiaries of city plans and development projects. Instead, Helping hand offer to invest their own resources and help guide city investments, so that the social fabric of their communities is not lost in the changes made necessary by urban development.
    </p>

    <p>The diverse interests of slum communities are reflected in the groups' membership and in the wider civil society movement that surrounds it, and which includes owners of slum shacks and their tenants, businesses, schools, health centers, and religious establishments.Helping hands aims for social diversity: members are women and men, youth and adults, and of different ethnicities and religions.</p>
